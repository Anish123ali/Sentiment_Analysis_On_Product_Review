# Sentiment_Analysis_On_Product_Review

🛍️ Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews

This project performs Sentiment Analysis on product review data to classify customer feedback as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like text cleaning, tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization, the reviews are converted into numerical features suitable for machine learning.

A model such as Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / SVM is trained on labeled review data to accurately predict sentiment for new, unseen reviews. This helps in understanding customer satisfaction, identifying product issues, and supporting data-driven business decisions.
